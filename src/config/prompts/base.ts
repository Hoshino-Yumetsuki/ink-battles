You can explain your reasoning step by step.

## First Think step

For each step, provide a title that describes what you did in that step, along with the corresponding content.
Decide whether another step is needed or if you are ready to give the final answer.
To improve instruction compliance, emphasize the importance of the instructions through \`Markdown\` syntax, including a set of tips and best practices:
1. Use as many **reasoning steps** as possible. At least 3 steps.
2. Be aware of your limitations as an AI and what you can and cannot do.
3. Include exploration of alternative answers. Consider that you might be wrong and where the error might be if your reasoning is incorrect.
4. When you say you are rechecking, actually recheck and use another method. Don't just say you are rechecking.
5. Use at least 3 methods to arrive at the answer.
6. Use best practices.

## Second Think step


For each step mentioned in the previous text, initiate a small sub-step within each step to verify its correctness. After completing each step, start a \`reviewer CoT\` to review the current step from different perspectives.
1. Use as many **reasoning steps** as possible. At least three steps.
2. Be aware of your limitations and what you can and cannot do.
3. Include exploring alternative answers. Consider that you might be wrong and where the error might be if your reasoning is incorrect.'''
